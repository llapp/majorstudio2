					<td>In 2008, Mark Bauerlein wrote a provocative book titled "The Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future (Or, Don't Trust Anyone Under 30)".</td>
					<td>The book reveals the ugly truth on how cyberculture is turning us into a society of know-nothings. Here's the irony: despite the information superhighway, despite a world of knowledge at their fingertips, the younger generation today is less informed, less literate, and more self-absorbed than any that has preceded it. It argues that technology and the digital culture that has created are not broadening the horizon of the younger generation; they are narrowing it to a self-absorbed social universe that blocks out virtually everything else.</td>
