- "Improving access to perishable, nutritious food in isolated communities in the North, NNC uses a market-driven model that directly subsidizes retailers, suppliers and country-food processors who meet program requirements. These parties are then required to pass on the full amount of the subsidies to consumers. There are two levels of subsidies that reflect the perishability and nutritional value of food products, with the highest subsidies provided for perishable nutritious goods." (TFS, 1)
