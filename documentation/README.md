# Patterns of vulnerability: Visualizing Northern Canadian food insecurity

http://llapp.github.io/majorstudio2

###Abstract
Although Canada has no official measure of poverty, food
insecurity—the financial and/or physical inability to access
adequate food—is present in homes across the country, with a
particularly severe prominence in Canada’s Northern territories
of the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Northern
Canada’s unique geographical and social landscape make
its residents especially vulnerable to food insecurity. Extreme
temperatures, low population density, isolated communities,
inconsistent access, and a higher Aboriginal population set
Canada’s north apart. Declining physical and mental health, the
deterioration of Aboriginal traditions, and a degeneration of
society are at stake while food insecurity exists.

Informed through current studies, reports, initiatives, and data
collection, this investigation strives to synthesize the available
resources into a single visual representation. The process
revealed the inconsistency and lack of granularity within publicly
available data related to Northern Canadian food insecurity,
as well as the many determinants which intersect to create
vulnerability within communities. The final visualization breaks
down the complexity of the issue into an organized narrative
in order to establish a foundational knowledge of Northern
Canadian food insecurity.
